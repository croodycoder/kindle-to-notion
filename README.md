Hey friends! If you like reading books on Kindle, you might have wondered how you could extract your highlights in an organized way and save them as notes. About an year ago, I built an app to sync Kindle highlights to a Notion database. While that app worked well, it was difficult for non-technical folks to set up as it required downloading software and running it on their system locally. So, I spent the last few days updating the app, so that you can setup and use this app directly from your browser, without having to install anything on your computer.
